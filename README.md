# team-profile-generator
The Team Profile Generator project is a JavaScript and Node.js focused project requiring the use of classes, contstructors, object arrays, Inquirier, Jest, unit tests, functions, and loops. I used the Inquirer package to create the different prompts for each team member type. Jest was added to run unit tests for each of the classes. The application is initialized in a terminal using the command "node index.js". This will initiate Inquirer which will run prompts in the CLI for a user to provide information about each team member to add to a team. Once all prompts are completed, the application will generate an HTML page displaying all the team members added to the team.
